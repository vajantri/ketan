Prakasha is a famous religious place and is popularly known as Dakshin Kashi. Prakasha is one of the fastest developing place in nandurbar district because of its location on state highway and has all facilities around the village including petrol station, civil hospital, junior college and school, and also some small scale industries.[1] The village is frequently flooded during the rainy season but the temple suffers from no damage despite its proximity to the river. The village turns into an island during floods as it is located at the junction of 2 rivers which cutoff the roads leading to village from both the sides.
